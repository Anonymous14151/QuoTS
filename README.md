# QuoTS
Matching patterns in time series with natural language

### Content Description
This repository has the code available to reproduce results and experiment
on any data that you might want to try on.
Some available signals can be used to try out QuoTS. 
Additionally, you have access to matlab livescripts with example of code
and search queries. 

We also provide a video of interacting with the interface.

### Scrolling and using content

The code can be used in several ways. You can use the individual functions available in "\functions\" as exemplified in "\examples\telemetry_examples.md", or calling the interface
from your own signal using the method **Quots(signal, win_size)**.

You can also use the available interface at "\interface\Quots_app.mlapp" and load the available example signals (example_1, example_2, example_3 and example_4). 

### Dataset

We share the acquired dataset, which can be used as "example_3" on the interface. More information on the dataset setup and acquisition is available at "datasets\example3\".
